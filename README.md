## 🏗️ System Architecture

![Architecture](docs/screenshots/architecture.png)

### Workflow

1. Students submit feedback using the web application hosted on Amazon S3.
2. Amazon API Gateway receives the request.
3. API Gateway invokes the AWS Lambda function.
4. Lambda processes the request and stores feedback in DynamoDB.
5. The Admin Dashboard retrieves feedback using a GET API endpoint.
6. Analytics and visualizations are generated dynamically.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

The Admin Dashboard is protected using session-based authentication.

Only authenticated users can access feedback records and analytics.
